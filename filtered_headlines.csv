Wallace, associate dean for judicial affairs at Duke University, will conduct a review of MIT’s actions regarding a harassment complaint filed by Julia M. Carpenter ’03 against a fellow Random Hall resident.Carpenter’s April 30 death was ruled a suicide by the Office of the Suffolk County Medical Examiners.   Since her death, Kenneth Arnold, the father of Carpenter’s boyfriend Zev Arnold, has written several letters to President Vest on the behalf of both the Arnold and Carpenter families suggesting that the Institute have an outside investigator conduct a review. Several questions have been raised as to whether current MIT disciplinary practices sufficiently address harassment cases and student deaths.Though the report will not be made public, its contents will help the Student Life Department improve MIT procedure for handling similar complaints. Wallace will also evaluate the Institute’s response to Carpenter’s  death and may offer better ways for MIT to handle student deaths.",http://tech.mit.edu/V121/N40//V121/N40/40carp.40n.html,"Friday, September 7, 2001"
